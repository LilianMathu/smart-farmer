                Making agriculture more attractive to young farmers and creating decent employment 
                opportunities in rural areas could reverse migration of youth to urban centres and abroad. 
                The migration of youth to urban centres increases the burden on African cities and leads to 
                the proliferation of slums.
                ‘Youth in agriculture’ is one of today’s hot
                topics – it seems like every development
                agency and initiative has activities that
                address this issue but most of them seem
                to focus on off-farm jobs. Many of them
                use ‘cool’ information communication
                technologies (ICTs) as the ‘hook’ to attract
                young people. All well and good; however
                such efforts ignore the elephant in the room.

                        <p className="text-muted">Relatively few students choose to study agriculture, perhaps in part because 
                        the quality of agricultural training is mixed. Taught materials need to be linked to advances in technology,
                         facilitate innovation and have greater relevance to a diverse and evolving agricultural sector, 
                         with a focus on agribusiness and entrepreneurship. Beyond technical skills, building capacity for 
                         management, decision-making, communication and leadership should also be central to higher education.
                          Reforms to agricultural tertiary education should be designed for young people and as such the process 
                          requires their direct engagement at school and during attachment.

                         program such as the one spearheaded by Beverly School of Kenya promoting agriculture among the youth
                         <strong>Vocational training and extension services</strong> are potentially effective tools for teaching agricultural
                            skills and providing capacity-building trainings for rural youth</p>

                        <p className="text-muted">With interest in agriculture rising, the question on the lips of many would-be 
                         how they can get funding for their start-ups. This is crucial for young people who do 
                            not have security for loans. In absence of accurate and cost-effective
                             methods for assessing small-scale agricultural lending. 
                            risk, financial institutions choose not to lend to smallholder farmers.
                            <strong>FarmDrive’s</strong> alternative credit risk assessment model is providing financial institutions with 
                            an agriculturally relevant and data-driven model to assess risk and develop loans that fit the needs 
                            of young smallholder farmers.

                        engagement, innovation and farming as a business. The media, ICT and social media can all be used to 
                        help better agriculture’s image across a broad audience and allow for sharing of information and
